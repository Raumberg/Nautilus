External script for tournaments
Hello everyone! I present to you an external script for schofield tournaments in Unturned
The operation of the application is quite simple to understand:
A special scanner reads the center of the screen every few milliseconds, 
And if the desired color is in the center, 
A signal is sent to the Windows API and the left mouse button is pressed (you are instantly making a shot)
